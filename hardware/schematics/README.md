# Schematics

This folder is reserved for the electrical schematics of the project.

At the current stage, the hardware is implemented using modular components
(Arduino and external modules) and is documented through wiring diagrams
available in `hardware/wiring/`.

Formal electrical schematics and PCB-ready designs may be added in future
revisions as the hardware architecture stabilizes.
