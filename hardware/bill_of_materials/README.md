# Bill of Materials

This project is built using off-the-shelf, modular hardware components.

The list below provides a high-level overview of the parts required to reproduce
the hardware prototype. Specific models, suppliers, or equivalents may be used
depending on availability.

## Core Components
- Arduino-compatible microcontroller board (Uno or Nano)
- 13.56 MHz RFID / NFC reader module
- 125 kHz RFID reader module
- Sub-GHz RF transceiver module
- Infrared receiver module
- Infrared LED transmitter

## Supporting Components
- Jumper wires (male–male, male–female)
- Current-limiting resistors (for LEDs)
- USB cable for power and programming

## Notes
Detailed wiring information and electrical considerations are documented in
