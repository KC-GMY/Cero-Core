# IR TX/RX – Notes

- A current-limiting resistor (220Ω–330Ω) is REQUIRED for the IR LED.
- D3 is used for IR transmission due to PWM capability (38 kHz carrier).
- D2 is interrupt-capable and suitable for accurate IR reception timing.
- Avoid direct sunlight or strong ambient IR sources during capture.
- IR receiver operates at 5V and is compatible with Arduino Uno/Nano.
